## Grokking Recursion

Thinking recursively by breaking down complex problems into manageable parts is more than just a skill. It's a problem-solving art that is a "must-have" for every programmer.

```bash
java -cp bin Main x
```

where `x` is an integer as the problem number below:

0. Hello World
1. Basic Sum
2. Factorial
3. Greatest Common Divisor
4. Converting Decimal to Binary
5. Check Prime
6. Perfect Square
7. Number Frequency
8. Pascal's Triangle
9. Binary Search
10. Inserting a new node in a BST
11. Merge Sort
12. Quick Sort
13. Removing nodes from Linked List
14. Fibonacci Series using Memoization
15. Good Number
