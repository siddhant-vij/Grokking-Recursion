## Grokking Recursion

Thinking recursively by breaking down complex problems into manageable parts is more than just a skill. It's a problem-solving art that is a "must-have" for every programmer.

```bash
java -cp bin Main x
```

where `x` is an integer as the problem number below:

0. Hello World
1. Basic Sum
2. Factorial
3. Greatest Common Divisor
4. Converting Decimal to Binary
5. Check Prime
6. Perfect Square
7. Number Frequency
8. Pascal's Triangle
9. Binary Search
10. Inserting a new node in a BST
11. BST Inorder Traversal
12. Merge Sort
13. Quick Sort
14. Depth First Search
15. Removing nodes from Linked List
16. Fibonacci Series using Memoization
17. Good Number
